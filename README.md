# TestTable1 - Bolt Learning Project

A test website built to learn and experiment with Bolt, featuring interactive sortable and filterable tables that can be modified by both humans and AI.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW:
    #Test website for learning Bolt framework capabilities.
    
     FEATURES:
        - Interactive data tables with sorting and filtering.
        - Human-editable table content.
        - AI-powered table modifications.
        - Real-time collaboration between human and AI.
        - Modern React/TypeScript implementation.

## TECHNICAL STACK:
    - React 18 with TypeScript.
    - Vite for fast development and building.
    - Tailwind CSS for styling.
    - ESLint for code quality.
    - PostCSS for CSS processing.

## GETTING STARTED:
    
     PREREQUISITES:
        - Node.js (version 16 or higher).
        - npm or yarn package manager.

     INSTALLATION:
        - Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`.
        - Navigate to project directory: `cd project-bolt-sb1-kkjagr4a/project`.
        - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
        - Start development server: `npm run dev`.

## USAGE:
    
     TABLE INTERACTIONS:
        - Click column headers to sort data.
        - Use filter inputs to search table content.
        - Edit cells directly by clicking on them.
        - AI can suggest and apply table modifications.

     AI INTEGRATION:
        - AI agent can analyze table data.
        - Automatic suggestions for data improvements.
        - Collaborative editing between human and AI.
